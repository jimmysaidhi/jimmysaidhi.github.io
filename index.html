	<h4>How testing has been conducted</h4>
	Most tests were automated. A few manual tests were written. <br>
	<ul>
		<li> Testing was automated using Jest, a Javascript testing framework developed by Facebook. </li>
		<li> 47 Test Suites (files) -> 46 automated and 1 manual </li>
		<li> 97 total tests -> 95 automated, 2 manual </li>
	</ul>

	<div>Manual tests
		<ul>
			<li> 2 manual end to end tests </li>

			<li> The file "manual_test_descriptions.txt" has step-by-step descriptions of each manual test</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>Snapshot tests
		<ul>
			<li> 36 Snapshot tests </li>
			<li> React Test Renderer - library used to render isolated components and take a snapshot of a JSON version of the HTML of the component</li>

			<li> Ensures component renders correctly without any unexpected changes </li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>Unit and Integration tests
		<ul>
			<li> 49 unit and integration tests </li>
			<li> Enzyme -  library used to simulate inputs and clicks on isolated components and check states and props </li>
			<li> React Testing Library - library used to simulate inputs and clicks on isolated components while avoiding referring to implementation details </li>
			<li> Supertest - library used to test models and api routes with a test Mongodb database </li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>End to End (e2e) tests
		<ul>
			<li> 10 end to end tests </li>
			<li> Puppeteer: library used to completely simulate user interaction with a website on a real browser</li>
